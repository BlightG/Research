# Abstract

- Knowledge graph reasoning has been attempted by logic-rule based approach and knowledge graph embeddings.
	- [[Markov logic Networks]] is a system for making inference on first order logic but its inference is difficult due to complicated graph strucutres.
	- Knowledge graph embeddings learn efective entity and relation embeddings but perfrom poor on domain knowledge.
