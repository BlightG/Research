- Definition: Abductive reasoning starts with an observation or set of observations and then seeks the simplest and most probable explanation among several possible explanations. It's about forming a hypothesis that best fits the available evidence.

- How it works: It looks for a cause-and-effect relationship to explain an observation, often with incomplete information.

- Certainty: Provides the most plausible explanation, but not certainty. Other explanations are still logically possible.

- Example:

	- Observation: The grass in the garden is wet.

	- Possible Explanations: It rained, the sprinklers were on, someone spilled a bucket of water.

	- Most Plausible Conclusion: It rained last night (because rain is the most common reason for widespread wet grass).

	- Analogy: Forming a hypothesis to explain a phenomenon, like a detective piecing together clues at a crime scene.
