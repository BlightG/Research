A **directed acyclic graph** (DAG) is a type of graph with the following properties:

---

### âœ… **Key Features**

1. **Directed**:

   * The edges (arrows) have a direction â€” they go from one node to another (e.g., A â†’ B).
2. **Acyclic**:

   * There are **no cycles**, meaning you cannot start at a node and follow a path of arrows that eventually loops back to that same node.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Example**

Consider this graph:

```
A â†’ B â†’ C
â†“
D
```

This is a DAG because:

* All arrows point in one direction.
* There's no way to start at any node and come back to it by following the arrows.

But this is **not** a DAG:

```
A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ A
```

Because it has a **cycle**: A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ A.

### ðŸ§  **Why DAGs Matter**

DAGs are widely used because they represent **cause-effect**, **dependency**, or **precedence** in a clean and logical way. Examples include:

* **Bayesian networks**: DAGs where nodes represent variables and edges represent probabilistic dependencies.
* **Task scheduling**: DAGs show what tasks must come before others.
* **Version control (Git)**: commits form a DAG.
* **Neural networks**: layers are connected in a DAG structure.
