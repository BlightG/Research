A **direct probabilistic dependency** means that **one variable has a direct influence on the probability of another** — specifically, knowing the value of one variable changes the probability distribution of another.

### 🔍 **Definition**

If we say:

> Variable **A** has a **direct probabilistic dependency** on variable **B**,  
> we mean:

P(A \mid B) \ne P(A)  
]

That is, the probability of **A** changes when we know something about **B**.

In a **Bayesian network**, this is represented with an arrow:

```
B → A
```

This means:

- **B is a parent of A**
    
- **A depends directly on B**

### 🧠 **Example:**

#### Scenario:

- Let **Rain** be variable RR
    
- Let **WetGrass** be variable WW
    

We say:

```
Rain → WetGrass
```

This means:

- There is a **direct probabilistic dependency** from **Rain** to **WetGrass**
    
- The probability of the grass being wet **depends on** whether it rained:
    

P(W=wet∣R=true)≠P(W=wet)P(W = \text{wet} \mid R = \text{true}) \ne P(W = \text{wet})

---

### ❗ Key Point

"Direct" means:

- There's **no need to go through another variable** to explain the influence.
    
- If A depends on B **only through** another variable C (e.g., A ← C → B), then A and B are **indirectly** dependent.
