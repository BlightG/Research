- **Definition:** Inductive reasoning starts with specific observations or instances and moves to a broader generalization or theory. It aims to identify patterns and predict future outcomes based on past experiences.
    
- **How it works:** It generalizes from specific observations.
    
- **Certainty:** Provides probability, not certainty. The conclusion is likely true, but not guaranteed, as future observations might contradict the generalization.
    
- **Example:**
    
    - Observation 1: Every swan I have seen so far is white.
        
    - Observation 2: I've seen hundreds of swans, all white.
        
    - Conclusion: Therefore, all swans are probably white. (This conclusion was famously disproven by the discovery of black swans in Australia).
        
- **Analogy:** Bottom-up logic.
