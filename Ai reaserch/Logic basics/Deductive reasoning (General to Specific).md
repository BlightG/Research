Definition: Deductive reasoning starts with a general statement, or hypothesis, and examines the possibilities to reach a specific, logically certain conclusion. If the premises are true, and the logic is valid, then the conclusion must be true.

How it works: It applies a general rule to a specific instance.

Certainty: Provides certainty. If the premises are true and the argument is structured correctly, the conclusion is guaranteed to be true.

Example:

Premise 1: All humans are mortal.

Premise 2: Socrates is a human.

Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

Analogy: Top-down logic.
