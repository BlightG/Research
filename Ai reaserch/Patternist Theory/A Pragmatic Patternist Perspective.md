This is a summary on the paper [The General Theory of General Intelligence: A Pragmatic Patternist Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15100)
## Introduction

The following are ways in which the engineering has been taken in AI

- Genetic Algorithms:
- Deep neural nets: Weak link to biology has increased in capability with growth of hardware capabilities.
- Logic based AI: expected to increase in efficiency when with rise of
	neural-symbolic systems.

### Summary of Key Points

1. The patternist theory views the mind and its intelegience is defined as a set of patterns associated with it.
2. It creates ascpects of intellegience such as evolution and self organization in a patternist way.
3. It formalizes what a pattern is using mathematical theory, 
	 - it uses [[AIT]] to define a pattern using it complexity or simplicity
	 - it adds combination systems on to of AIT to allow simple patterns to create more complex patters
4. It uses distinction graphs which are the basis of differentiating between patterns which is a requirement before applying logic on patterns. For more [[Laws of Form]].
5. The distinction graphs discussed above and extened with use of type information to enrich thier knowledge.
6. the 6th key point uses this terms:
	- paraconsistent-logic: logic which can be contradict itself
	- probabilistic logic: logic described as degree of truth
	- fuzzy logic: Allows truths to be graded
7. it uses distinction metta graphs where programs are run and uses cury-howards correspondace. For more [[7th]]
8. intelligence should not be qunatified by a single value but it can have emergent quantifieable values like joy and growth.
9. Formalization of "goal-achievement skill" aspect of intelligence of AIT is interesting.
10. The 10th point refers "Maximal Algorthmic Caliber1" which needs further checking
11. cognitive synergy is critical to achieve AGI via different sort of learning processes can interact and share internal state to help with dead-locks and bottlenecks.
12. 

## Patternist Philosophy of Mind

- Gaps between practical AGI and *phylosophy of mind* is not entierly obvious
